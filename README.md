#Project: EK210-A1-DrugDevCode

#Summary

Intended for use on Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano board that is being powered with a constant current of 3amps and by at least 5V. 

The Arduino is controlling the internal temperature of a thermus that has been filled with expanding foam, a copper cylinder and a copper plate that is in contact with a Peltier device. The Peltier device is what heats and cools the interior depending on the temperature range constraints.

One of the device constraints is that it must be portable and must be powered by a 5v usb port in a car. The testing was succesful in a car and the desired temperature was acheived at multiple different ranges.
